Project C.2
<p>Scoring the result of the closed questions, the analysis of the open questions, the interviewersâ€™ observations and the examination of other evidence during the interviews allowed for the general analysis of this item. However, it is also important to explain the numerical result of what is quantifiable, such as in line with the assumptions presented in Analyzing the rows in , we observe that the only block that is integrally bonded to the model for all cases is the characterization of IT projects. For others, there are within-case variations. The remaining blocks vary in adherence according to the company searched. Observing the score for the event, the company that comes closest to the model, restricted to the quantitative view, is supplier B. The results of the research versus the assumptions of H4, H5 and H6 are detailed in sections 6.3 through 6.6 of this chapter.
