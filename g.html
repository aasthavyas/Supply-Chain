Project D.1
<p>The interpretations of this item are based on the premise that there must be an improvement in the level of interaction between suppliers and customers.
The research result shows that companies have a level of interaction with their suppliers and customers that evolves and does not fully adhere to the model, as in Tserng & Lin p. 107-108), Kern & Willcocks claim an improvement in the relationship success factor benefits the subcontracting process. Although most managers interviewed stated that their level of interaction is appropriate, they also recognized that there were problems such as a lack of clear rules of engagement and informality in processes involving new suppliers or subcontracting. The client company that is closest to the model is Company C, and the supplier company that is closest to the model is Company B. The highlight of the findings related to client company C is that there are clear rules for approval and competition among providers and principles of social responsibility that influence the company’s relationship and interaction with suppliers.
From a supplier’s point of view, one respondent commented that there are situations in which customers were technically unprepared, that the relationships were not always good and often that problems with projects were blamed on suppliers, which in his view was incorrect. Another supplier took the position that clients should have an organizational focus on projects with innovative components, particularly with regard to planning for the time and resources necessary to absorb new knowledge. According to supplier companies’ project managers, projects with innovative components cannot be managed in the same way as projects that use technologies known by the customers. The other highlight related to the supplier B, which showed total adherence in the search for appropriate interaction with its customers, using many of the processes of PM and the benefits of KM in projects for its clients. Although supplier B did not completely adhere to the model in the general context of all cases, as observed in the case of client company C, in the case of supplier B and the reports of managers from other companies, this need and trend in the model search is proposed as a success factor in subcontracting and achieving project objectives.
