Project A.1
<body>
<p>This article addresses the issue of implementing projects with technological innovation in an organization that is internalizing such new knowledge. The need for innovation is caused by the competitiveness that forces organizations to invest in product and service innovations to ensure their survival
Innovative products and services in a complex environment of Information Technology (IT) require structured projects that can be custom developed by third parties
The distinction between the most innovative companies is made apparent by the right supplier-customer relationship. Those companies are the most concerned with anticipating market trends and innovative practice of substantive character, .
The need for structured projects requires knowledge of Project Management (PM). Due to the focus on core competencies and the internal knowledge gap, PM subcontracts to bring innovation to an organization. This gap in technical knowledge is natural in an organization before it implements new technologies in an IT project and creates two important risk factors: the risk created by the project itself and the risk created by lack of knowledge, 
System integration projects are those that need to relate to various existing systems and are of relative complexity. These projects require new technologies, which often lack internal knowledge.
This article describes a survey focused on complex projects involving new technologies unknown to the buyer. This focus is important because this context characterizes the problem that is addressed and the existence of a gap in technical knowledge on the part of the client company in relation to the supplier’s knowledge.
This article is organized by the following chapters: Introduction, Conceptual Aspects (technological innovation, knowledge management and acquisition management), Problem (characterization of the problem and model of the problem), Grouping Hypotheses (proposed model of knowledge transfer), Study Cases (research planning, developing cases, step by step implementation of the study and research limitations), Results (consolidation of the research results, score-based analysis of adherence to the model, comparison of results between suppliers and customers level, interaction between customer and supplier knowledge transfer process, process of knowledge transfer, whether a process is conducive to knowledge management, and knowledge transfer), Results of Questions, Future Research, and Final Thoughts. See article summary in below.
