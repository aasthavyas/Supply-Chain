# SUPPLY CHAIN BUDDY
# Problem: 
Developing teams have to spend excessive amount of time to explain the ideas which leads to a lot of confusion regarding service or product that needs to be provided. Increased volatility of customer demand and commodity can lead to formation of complex patterns within organization leading to a crossed web system functioning
# Proposed Solution:
We implemented a web app in which a Chatbot helps us to improve interdepartment communication. We have used basic NLP algorithms to provide better search results. In addition, there is a Frequently Asked Questions(FAQâ€™s) for general concerns and basic information including an embedded google search.
