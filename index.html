			<h1>Welcome</h1>
			<p>At Dell, we hold ourselves and our suppliers to a high standard of excellence, prioritizing responsibility and sustainability. We work with our suppliers and through groups like the Responsible Business Alliance to set and abide by high standards that respect and protect our workers, communities, and the environment.
			We know customers have questions about our supply chain. We strive for 100% transparency, and as part of that we opened the doors to our suppliersâ€™ and our own manufacturing facilities in 2016; allowing customers to see first-hand how our products are made and the people who make them.
