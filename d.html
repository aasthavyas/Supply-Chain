Project B.2
<p>The hypotheses were developed through the literature review. The H1, H2, and H3 hypotheses were used to confirm the sample of the cases, and the H4, H5, and H6 hypotheses were used to analyze forms of knowledge transfer.
Once the problem to be solved and the points to be investigated are clearly understood, the model developed to represent the transfer of knowledge described is can be presented. So far, the study shows that the literature has provided no specific model that solves the problem posed or specifically answers the questions proposed in this paper. Thus, we propose a model based on other models that partially respond to our proposal.
The above model has a core that is intended to guide the actions and interactions between a client company and its supplier. The client company engages in a number of internal activities, represented on the left. The client company has IT projects that incorporate technological innovation that remains focused on its “core business” and provides subcontracting suppliers with knowledge necessary for technological innovations. With regard to creating an environment that is conducive to KM, there is a need to create a capture process, an organization, access to and the use of new knowledge. The company should also seek to use IT tools for the storage and dissemination of new knowledge.
The PM process must contemplate the planning of this process. The supplier, represented on the right, possesses the technology, expertise and knowledge that are to be transferred.
Regarding interactions between firms, clear rules for the qualification and delivery of knowledge must be established. One should seek a higher degree of formalization and focus on the processes of transfer of new knowledge. At the core of the model is the process of knowledge transfer. This process consists of mapping activity related to gaps in knowledge, new knowledge documentation, previous training and mentoring process. At its core, this model basically consists of the model proposed, which presents a framework for selecting a KM strategy that can be used as a basic model to identify knowledge needs, the target knowledge to be transferred and finally, the selection of the method of knowledge transfer. This model can also be complemented with the observations of, Medina (2012), It is also suggested that this transfer would not be effective without a good relationship between the client company and its suppliers, who are subcontractors for creating IT projects. This assertion is supported by who claim that the improvement of relationships is a factor in the success of the subcontracting process. The process of interactions between a client company and its supplier is also critical in this model, more precisely at the moment of a company’s choice of supplier and/or technical solution. A client company that needs an innovation solution has not yet learned to judge the best or most appropriate solution for its business problem. In such a case, one can rely on a model of interaction among companies synthesized in the model as interactions, explain, it is essential to create or maintain an environment conducive to KM. Therefore, it is suggested here that some processes of PM are increasingly streamlined and effective, and it is also suggested that companies improve their relationships with suppliers and create a conducive environment for KM.
