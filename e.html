Project C.1
<p>To test the model shown the case study research method was considered appropriate because it enabled the analysis of several companies, suppliers and customers with an appropriate degree of depth and a specific focus on new technologies, as described below and as recommended.
Data collection was carried out through closed-question interviews, which provided the researcher with a more accurate picture of the environment to be searched, although there were also open-ended questions to complement the information obtained. This format was based on a questionnaire interview that previously prepared and was answered by “informants” and presented the interview as “structured” or as “a formal survey”. A personal interview enabled the project managers to present their interpretations of certain events. Furthermore, the interviews relied on an important complementary factor: direct observation through a field visit. To facilitate the proper chain of evidence and to obtain a proper comparison between the respondents’ information, or even comparing the cases together, we used the Likert scale process as a way to measure and quantify the results related to the blocks referenced in the questionnaire.
Because the object of the research is the flow of knowledge between suppliers and their customers, we selected three customer companies represented by three major banks characterized by their volume of assets and two major suppliers characterized by their volume of sales. For reasons of confidentiality, the names and identifying organizations where the case studies were conducted were omitted.  presents a summary table containing information about the main characteristics of the studied organizations.
