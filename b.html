Project A.2
<p>During the research on the meaning of knowledge, it was identified that there are difficulties in its conceptualization. As with knowledge itself, its concept is fluid and subjective and in this paper, the concept defined by  is used. Knowledge covers a scope with boundaries that are not well defined. It always has a goal, a target to be reached, an action and a meaning; it requires a base of information, which can be suppressed by skills and competencies, but it mainly depends on the beliefs and attitudes of the people who possess that information. Therefore, knowledge is always connected to human actions, which are based on and correlated with a set of information, giving them meaning so as to perform some actions. Knowledge is also compared to an iceberg, in which the visible part is the knowledge that can be made explicit and the submerged part is tacit knowledge, or those concepts present in the process of knowledge creation, which is called the SECI model, (Socialization, Externalization, Combination and Internalization).
Through the process of socialization, tacit knowledge is passed from one person to another. Externalization, i.e., the structure and organization of knowledge, makes it explicit that combining knowledge with knowledge leads to the internalization and consolidation of new tacit knowledge. That knowledge then goes back to the beginning of the cycle, where more knowledge can be generated is based on studies of IT adoption and implementation and identifies a large number of factors that may impact the process of transferring IT projects and associated knowledge. Twenty-three factors are identified and grouped into the following five categories: individual, organizational, innovation, task-related and environmental factors. Another proposal for transfer of knowledge is presented by , using a framework based on the literature and case studies. The first case addresses the difficulty of explanation experienced by technical professionals, and the second case discusses a situation in which a company has a large amount of information that it does not use properly in the decision-making process. In this case, the problem discussed relates to:
Challenges in documenting technical information;
Knowledge distributed in different countries; and
Information that is critical to a company.
